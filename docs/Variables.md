# Variables

Variables allow the sharing of values between Rules. Variables have scope at the Global, Event, or Message level. Message variables cannot be changed directly. Other variables can be set by Thens or in the UI (Global variables only). Variables can be read by Whens and Thens.

Event variables are shared among rules running on a single HTTP event (request or response).

Global variables are shared among multiple HTTP events for as long at the extension is loaded or until the variables are deleted. Global variables can be set to be Persistent in the Global Variables tab of Reshaper. Persistent variables will be saved and reloaded between Reshaper sessions.

Message variables correspond to message values (e.g. Request URI).

## Variable Tags

Variables can be read by Whens and Thens when a variable tag is specified in supporting text fields.
{% raw %}
Event Variable Tag: `{{event:MyVariableName}}`

Global Variable Tag: `{{global:MyVariableName}}`

Message Variable Tag: `{{message:messageValueKey}}` or `{{message:messageValueKey:identifier}}` (e.g. `{{message:httprequesturi}}`, `{{message:httprequestheader:Host}}`). See [Message Values](MessageValues.html#)

For example, if Global variable named `firstName` has the value `John` and variable named `lastName` has the value `Smith`. A field with the value `{{global:firstName}}'s full name is {{global:firstName}} {{global:lastName}}` will be read as `John's full name is John Smith`.
{% endraw %}
